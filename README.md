# Pysics-Based Deep Learning

This repository collects links to works on _deep learning algorithms for physics
problems_, with a paricular emphasis on _fluid flow_, i.e., Navier-Stokes related
problems. It especially collects links to the works of the I15 lab at TUM, as
well as miscellaneous works from other groups. This is by no means a complete
list, so let us know if you come across additional papers in this area. We
intentionally also focus on works from the _deep learning_ field, not machine
learning in general.
